## differences between on-premises sql database and azure sql database

- Deployment: On-premises SQL databases are installed and run on physical hardware within an organization's data center, while Azure SQL databases are cloud-based and run on Microsoft's Azure platform.

- Scalability: Azure SQL databases can easily scale up or down based on changing workload demands, while on-premises SQL databases require additional hardware and resources to be added for scalability.

- Maintenance and Management: Azure SQL databases are managed and maintained by Microsoft, while on-premises SQL databases require dedicated IT staff to manage and maintain hardware, software updates, and security.

- Availability and Disaster Recovery: Azure SQL databases provide built-in high availability and disaster recovery options, such as geo-replication and automatic failover, while on-premises SQL databases require manual setup and maintenance of these features.

- Cost: On-premises SQL databases typically require significant upfront investment in hardware and software, while Azure SQL databases are based on a pay-as-you-go model with flexible pricing options based on usage.

- Security: Azure SQL databases provide advanced security features such as encryption, access control, and threat detection that may not be available in on-premises SQL databases without additional investment in security tools and software.

Overall, Azure SQL databases offer greater flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, while on-premises SQL databases offer greater control and customization options but require more upfront investment in hardware and IT staff. The choice between the two will depend on an organization's specific needs and priorities.

## Azure SQL databases unsupported features

- Cross-database queries: In on-premises SQL Server, it's possible to write queries that join data from multiple databases on the same server. This feature is not currently supported in Azure SQL databases.

- SQL Server Agent: Azure SQL databases do not support SQL Server Agent, which is used for scheduling and automating tasks such as backups, maintenance, and notifications.

- Distributed Transactions: Distributed transactions are used to coordinate transactions across multiple databases or systems. While supported in on-premises SQL Server, distributed transactions are not supported in Azure SQL databases.

- Filestream data: Filestream data allows for the storage and management of large files such as documents, images, and video within SQL Server. This feature is not currently supported in Azure SQL databases.

- CLR integration: CLR (Common Language Runtime) integration allows for the execution of .NET code within SQL Server. While supported in on-premises SQL Server, CLR integration is not supported in Azure SQL databases.

- Linked servers: Linked servers allow for the querying of data across multiple database servers. While supported in on-premises SQL Server, linked servers are not supported in Azure SQL databases.
